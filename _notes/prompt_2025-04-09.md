The app in project knowledge is nearing completion. The architecture and most of the features are in place, so at this point we don't want to make any fundamental changes. However there are outstanding bugs. We will address these one at a time, keeping any changes to the minimum necessary. I will give you the error message and you should suggest bugfixes. Unless they are minor changes, please provide the complete revised source code of whichever file is affected as an artifact, clearly labeled as to its location.

The app in project knowledge is nearing completion. The architecture and most of the features are in place, so at this point we don't want to make any fundamental changes. However there are outstanding bugs. We will address these one at a time, keeping any changes to the minimum necessary. I will give you the error message and you should suggest bugfixes. Unless they are minor changes, please provide the complete revised source code of whichever file is affected as an artifact, clearly labeled as to its location.

We are currently working on moving the state management system of the app in project knowledge from a simple setup to one that's redux-like. It's currently a bit of a hybrid mess. Please analyse existing code to see the current situation, think deeply about how to migrate to soley using the new system. Once you have found solutions moving forward, please double-check to make sure they don't break current user-level functionality. Then please show me the new code. Unless they are minor changes, please provide the complete revised source code of whichever file is affected as an artifact, clearly labeled as to its location.

## Key Differences

1. **Data Flow**:

   - Simple: Direct mutations to state via `update(key, value)`
   - Redux-like: Unidirectional data flow through actions and reducers

2. **State Changes**:

   - Simple: Explicit mutations of specific state keys
   - Redux-like: Pure functions (reducers) calculate new state based on actions

3. **Predictability**:

   - Simple: Less predictable as any component can mutate state directly
   - Redux-like: More predictable as all changes follow the same pattern

4. **Debugging**:

   - Simple: Harder to track where changes come from
   - Redux-like: Actions provide a log of all state changes

5. **Middleware Support**:
   - Simple: Typically doesn't support middleware
   - Redux-like: Supports middleware for side effects, logging, etc.

Core State Management Files (New Structure)

- src/core/state/action-types.js - Action type constants
- src/core/state/actions.js - Action creators using the utility function
- src/core/state/reducers.js - All reducers plus combined root reducer
- src/core/state/selectors.js - Pure functions to select data from state
- src/core/state/store.js - Store creation with subscription capability
- src/core/state/utils.js - Utility functions (combineReducers, createAction)
- src/core/state/index.js - Main entry point that exports everything

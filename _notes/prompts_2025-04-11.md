Can you please create a concise document together with one mermaid diagrams showing the architecture of Squirt. Please include references to sorce files and classes, with emphasis on those in the core. Please render the document and diagrams as completely separate artifacts, don't include one in the other.

on loading the app, using `src/services/endpoints/endpoints-service.js` the system should first try to access the previously saved endpoints found in localstorage. If this is unavailable, the endpoint values should be loaded from `src/config.json`. If this also fails, the endpoint hardcoded in `getDefaultEndpoints()` should be used. If any endpoint is found to be unavailable Warning: orange background notification should be briefly given and the status reflected in `src/ui/components/endpoint-indicator.js`. When a connection is successfully made this a notification should be briefly given once at this point.

Can you please refactor `src/domain/rdf/model.js` so that the core RDF model functionality is provided in `src/domain/model.js` and more specific models are accessed as profiles which delegate to the core model, eg. `src/domain/profiles/post.js` will contain post-related methods. Give the new code as complete, individual artifacts.

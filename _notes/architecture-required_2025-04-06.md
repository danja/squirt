# Squirt App Architectural Details

1. **Decoupled Architecture**

   - clear layers (core, domain, services, UI)
   - event bus for communication between components
   - no circular dependencies

2. **State Management**

   - Redux-like central store
   - reducers for predictable state updates
   - selectors for consistent data access

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**

   - error type hierarchy
   - Centralized error processing and logging
   - user-friendly error notifications

4. **Modular Services**

   - storage, SPARQL, RDF, and endpoints in services
   - interfaces Implemented with dependency injection
   - factory functions for service instantiation

5. **Testing Support**
   - comprehensive unit tests
   - integration test for application flow
   - mocks and testing utilities as necessary

## Implementation Details

### Core

1. **Event Bus**

   - pub/sub event system
   - event types with constants
   - Components communicate through events, not direct references

2. **Error Handling**

   - AppError base class and specific subtypes
   - Centralized error handler with consistent logging
   - user-friendly error notifications

3. **State Management**
   - Redux-like store and reducers
   - action creators for type safety
   - selectors for data access

### Service Layer

1. **Storage Service**

   - abstract interface for storage
   - localStorage and in-memory variants
   - error handling for storage operations

2. **SPARQL Service**

   - SPARQL operations Decoupled from endpoint management
   - proper error handling for network and SPARQL errors
   - events for query and update lifecycle

3. **Endpoints Service**

   - Separate endpoint management and SPARQL operations
   - status monitoring and health checks
   - event-based status notifications

4. **RDF Service**
   - Split domain model from service implementation
   - pure functions for RDF operations
   - proper error handling and events

### UI

1. **Router**

   - hash-based routing
   - view lifecycle management
   - event-based navigation system

2. **Notifications**
   - centralized notification system
   - consistent UI for notifications
   - state-based rendering

## Testing Improvements

1. **Unit Tests**

   - tests for core functionality
   - mock implementations for services
   - full test coverage for critical components

2. **Integration Tests**
   - tests for application lifecycle
   - Test service interactions
   - Verify event-based communication

## Next Steps

1. **Complete View Implementations**

   - Refactor remaining UI components
   - Implement remaining views
   - Add component tests

2. **Improve Documentation**

   - Add detailed API documentation
   - Create developer guide
   - Document architecture decisions

3. **Add Feature Enhancements**
   - Implement offline support
   - Add data synchronization
   - Improve UI/UX
